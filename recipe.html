            <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
            <h4>FILLING</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the berries and pat dry. Mash up half of the blueberries in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, salt and tapioca flour. Add the mashed blueberries, orange juice and orange zest and stir to combine. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. Fold in the whole berries.</li>
                <li>Line a 9-inch pie plate with aluminum foil. Place the blueberry mixture into the foil and place in the freezer until solid, approximately 6 to 8 hours.
                    <ul>
                        <li>You'll have a pie waiting for you when winter rolls around!</li>
                        <li>Or you can get right to baking..</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>BAKING</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Unroll first piece of dough and place into a 9-inch pie pan, making sure the dough reaches to the lip of the pie pan. Trim excess, if necessary. Prick the bottom and sides with a fork and set aside.</li>
                <li>Unroll second piece of dough and cut into 1 1/8-inch wide strips (should result in 9 to 10 strips). I use a pizza cutter for this but a sharp-pointed paring knife will work also, as long as the dough is chilled.</li>
                <li>Remove the frozen pie filling from the freezer and place into the prepared dough in the pan.</li>
                <li>Although lattice tops can be built directly on the pie, I rather weave it separately, wrap in foil and refrigerate for half an hour or so before placing it on the top of the pie. See drawings below for assembly guide.</li>
                <li>Position the lattice on top of the pie and crimp around the edge with a fork. (If you refrigerated it beforehand, place on top of pie and leave at room temperature for 10 minutes before continuing.)</li>
                <li>Lightly brush the edge of the crust with the egg yolk and place pie on the bottom rack of the oven. Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes or until the pie bubbles around the edges.</li>
                <li>Place the pie on a rack and cool to room temperature before serving, approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>LATTICE</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove every other strip leaving 4-5 horizontally aligned.</li>
                <li>Weave the removed strips vertically into the horizontal strips creating a basket-weave lattice.</li>
            </ol>
