# CS312-Lab1_2
Lab 1_2 for CS312. This lab covers the basics of html and displays the ability to format, create tables, and create ordered and unordered lists.

Most labs are hosted on the CSU servers. For security reasons I will not be posting the exact link, but the page can be viewed through live server in vs code.
